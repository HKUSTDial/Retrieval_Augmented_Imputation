# Reranker

This project is built upon the [original Reranker project](https://github.com/luyug/Reranker), which provides a lightweight, effective and efficient package for training and deploying deep language model reranker in information retrieval (IR), question answering (QA) and other NLP tasks.

## Installation and Dependencies

### Installing Reranker
Reranker relies on PyTorch, Hugging Face Transformers, and Datasets. To install, run:

```sh
pip install .
```

### Verified Dependency Versions
Reranker has been tested with the following versions:
- `torch==1.6.0`
- `transformers==4.2.0`
- `datasets==1.1.3`

If you encounter compatibility issues, consider using the specified versions.

### Development Installation
For development purposes, install Reranker in editable mode:

```sh
pip install -e .
```

## Pretrained Model

We use the [BERT-based reranker](https://huggingface.co/Luyu/bert-base-mdoc-bm25) to initialize our reranker. You can download the model and specify its local path in `train.sh`.


## Usage

See the main README in the parent directory for training and testing instructions.
